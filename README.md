# Housing_price_predict

This project is for COPM9321

This is a system for predicting house prices.

Firstly, run run.py in the folder final_work.

Then, you will be returned to a web site.

Open it and you get the home page of the system, enter or select most of value, and then click the start predict button.

If you enter something wrong, the browser will remind you to make sure that the range and data type of input is correct.

When everything is correct, you will get a predicted price as the return value.
